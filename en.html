                    <p>The project consisted in the development of a digital interactive learning platform for mathematics teaching based in learning trails and inspired in the <a href="https://proceedings.science/unicamp-pibic/pibic-2021/trabalhos/residencia-pedagogica-cadernos-autocorretivos-como-ferramenta-de-aprendizagem-no?lang=pt-br">Auto-corrective Notebooks: Fractions</a> developed by the pedagogic residency of Math Education at Unicamp. The platform was created with modular and replicable resources, with an intuitive and user-friendly interface. The goal was to provide a positive experience of learning to the users and help them understand math activities from examples and tests.</p>
                    <p>I started the project in 2022, researching more about the auto-corrective notebooks and in 2023 started the platform's development, which has been discontinued.</p>
                    <p>During this project, I was awarded a 'PICME' research grant and oriented by professor <a href="https://ime.unicamp.br/~mfirer">Marcelo Firer</a>.</p>

                    <p>Delta Jr is the first Educational Junior Enterprise in the world. Since 2018, the JE offers services in math education to students, families, teachers, platforms, editors and educational institutions.</p>
                    <p>I joined Delta in 2022 as a project analist until the end of 2023. Withal, I've been the JE's Vice-President and Counsellor in 2023.</p>
                    <p>I managed and executed a big spectrum of projects, including analysis of teaching material and coordination of educational events, like Unicamp's Math Olympiad.</p>
                    <p>I have worked a lot with data analysis and developed many spreadsheets in the process, besides websites. Moreover, I have worked with documents layout and publishing.</p>

                    <p>In 2022, I was part of the committee for my course's Academic Week ("SeProMat"). I have worked specially with the logistics during the event, beyond looking for partenrships previously.</p>
                    <p>Though I was not part of the committee in 2023, I was responsible for automating certificate issuance.</p>

                    <p>I was Executive President of the Junior Enterprises Core in Campinas region ("Núcleo Campinas"), which is the body that represents, enhances and articulates the junior enterprises in the neighboring municipalities of Campinas.</p>
                    <p>As Executive President, I was responsible for the network expansion front and institutional relationship front, as well as accelerating and regulating the 45+ already existing local junior enterprises.</p>

                        <h3>Monitoring Fernanda</h3>
                        <p class="periodo">2023/1 - 2024/1</p>
                    </header>
                    <p>Fernanda was an elementary school student. On account of respiratory failures during babyhood, she had compromised motor function, memory and speak (Wernicke's Syndrome). She relies on an oxygenation device, besides a permanent tracheostomy tube. Because of her limited communication, <strong>I was hired to help integrate her to the educational environment</strong>, acting as an intermediate between her and her teachers and colleagues. Thus, <em>the process focused on Inclusion</em>.</p>
                    <p>Fernanda studied in a private small school, with one class per grade, which fomented high interation among students, continued contact with teachers and, in general, her inclusion. School's method was traditional: student handout and chalkboard; hence, I sought to bring <strong>supplementary material</strong> to auxiliate her.</p>
                    <p>Furthermore, Fernanda is in literacy process, being monitored by a psychopedagogue and a speech therapist. As reported, there was a previous attempt to educate her in sign language, but her motor limitations disrupted the process. Since then, she had been oralized with a mixed model (which uses signs to emphasize phonemes). During my work with her, <em>I was able to teach her over 30 signs in Brazilian Sign Language (LIBRAS)</em>, with which she could compose a few ideas.</p>

                    <p>Go Big Project was a project to democratize education, formed by High School students interested in extracurricular activities. The motion was to connect experienced students to allow stranded students have access to academic contests.</p>
                    <p>I stood as a monitor somewhile and taught over 10 olympiad level classes. I developed a learning path through Google Classroom and developed my own material for the classes.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, I was responsible for completely restructuring and rewriting the project's website.</p>
