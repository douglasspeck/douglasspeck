## Who am I?

I am a brazilian young adult, currently studying Math Education at [Universidade Estadual de Campinas](https://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/) and incoming **polymath**. I am **passionate** about design and digital interfaces in educational processes.

## My Toolbox
I am well experienced with design concepts and tools such as Figma, GIMP and Inkscape.
I have worked with native PHP, CSS and JS and don't particularly like any libraries for such languages.
Also, I significantly comprehend and use acessibility design concepts within my projects.
